Below is a meta-extension of your Breakthrough-Idea Walkthrough (the 9-step or so framework) that adds sub-steps or mini-prompts to each step. These sub-steps let you (or your orchestration script) push the LLM to break down the brainstorming even further, eventually creating actionable tasks for you to implement.

Use this extended version if you want the LLM to produce not just the high-level text at each step but also a set of “action items” or finer sub-steps for each phase.

Extended Breakthrough Framework (With Sub-Steps)
Below is the recommended structure in 9 main steps (you can tailor the number), each with sub-prompts or mini-requests to produce deeper breakdowns. This approach is flexible—you control how many sub-levels or tasks you want the LLM to output.

Step 1) Context & Constraints
Goal: Summarize domain or problem constraints and gather obscure references from the LLM.
Extended Approach:
Sub-Step A: Summarize domain context.
Sub-Step B: Identify unusual references or cross-domain knowledge.
Sub-Step C: Provide an “initial short list of 3–5 potential synergy angles” that might lead to breakthroughs.
Prompts:

System Prompt: “You are a specialized consultant. In Step 1A, do [X]... in Step 1B, do [Y]... in Step 1C, etc.”
User Prompt: “Step 1: Summarize constraints, gather lesser-known references, produce synergy angles. No disclaimers.”
Result:

The LLM gives a short “context doc,” plus a list of synergy angles.
Each synergy angle can feed into Step 2.
Step 2) Divergent Brainstorm of Solutions
Goal: Generate multiple novel solutions.
Extended Approach:
Sub-Step A: For each synergy angle from Step 1C, produce at least 2 distinct solution sketches → total 6–10.
Sub-Step B: Rate each solution on originality, feasibility, potential impact, but avoid disclaimers.
Sub-Step C: Convert the top 3 solutions into a more detailed outline.
Prompts:

“Step 2: For each synergy angle, produce multiple solutions. Then do sub-step B to rate them. Then sub-step C to pick top solutions.”
Result:

LLM outputs a bigger set of potential solutions.
The top 3 are chosen for deeper analysis in Step 3.
Step 3) Deep-Dive on Chosen Solutions
Goal: Thorough analysis of each selected solution.
Extended Approach:
Sub-Step A: For each chosen solution, do a 1–2 page deep-dive (theory, domain synergy, example scenario).
Sub-Step B: Propose key resources or advanced references needed.
Sub-Step C: List 3–5 action items for each solution if one wanted to prototype it.
Prompts:

“Step 3: For each top solution from Step 2, produce a thorough analysis (sub-step A), required references (sub-step B), and 3–5 actionable tasks (sub-step C).”
Result:

The LLM’s output is not just a deep concept explanation but also short, practical tasks to begin implementing or testing each solution.
Step 4) Self-Critique & Merge
Goal: LLM self-critique or unify the best aspects from the 3 solutions.
Extended Approach:
Sub-Step A: Evaluate each solution’s limitations or synergy.
Sub-Step B: Propose 2 merged approaches.
Sub-Step C: For each merged approach, produce a short “Implementation Rationale.”
Prompts:

“Step 4: Critique each solution (no disclaimers about feasibility, just improvements). Then produce 2 merged solutions, each with rationale for how they unify the best aspects.”
Result:

The LLM effectively merges ideas and justifies how the synergy might form a real “breakthrough approach.”
Step 5) Final “Breakthrough Blueprint”
Goal: Solidify the final solution as a single blueprint.
Extended Approach:
Sub-Step A: Summarize it in 3–5 paragraphs.
Sub-Step B: Provide a bullet list of 10 actionable steps to realize it.
Sub-Step C: (Optional) Provide an ASCII or block diagram.
Prompts:

“Step 5: Combine everything into one blueprint. Sub-step A: summary. Sub-step B: 10 actionable tasks. Sub-step C: diagram.”
Result:

A fully integrated doc with a short list of next steps to get started.
Step 6) Implementation & Risk Minimization Plan
Goal: Create a more detailed plan addressing risk, resource constraints, time estimates.
Extended Approach:
Sub-Step A: Provide a timeline (like 3–6 months).
Sub-Step B: Outline potential roadblocks, but keep solutions.
Sub-Step C: Summarize each milestone’s success criteria.
Prompts:

“Step 6: Implementation plan with sub-step A for timeline, sub-step B for roadblocks + solutions, sub-step C for success metrics. Keep it real, no disclaimers.”
Result:

You get a more “project manager” style breakdown with each phase spelled out.
Step 7) Cross-Check with Known Projects
Goal: The LLM tries to see if anything in open-source or known references is close.
Extended Approach:
Sub-Step A: List existing open-source or research efforts that share partial elements.
Sub-Step B: Distill the unique points that go beyond those references.
Sub-Step C: Summarize why this blueprint remains fresh or unique.
Prompts:

“Step 7: Cross-check the blueprint with any known project. Sub-step B: highlight novelty. Sub-step C: finalize unique selling points.”
Step 8) Additional Q&A or Clarifications
Goal: Let you finalize the approach with any follow-up questions.
Extended Approach:
Sub-Step A: You ask your final clarifications or expansions.
Sub-Step B: LLM elaborates them.
Sub-Step C: Possibly produce any code stubs or mini specs if you want.
Prompts:

“Step 8: Let me finalize queries. Sub-step A: I ask. Sub-step B: you answer. Sub-step C: produce code stubs (if relevant). No disclaimers.”
Result:

You get any final expansions, concluding the “Breakthrough” process.
How to Use
In your code: replicate your multi-step orchestration approach. For each step (1–8), you feed a System Prompt and a User Prompt with the sub-step instructions you desire.
Enforce the “No disclaimers about feasibility” policy in each step’s system prompt.
Include references to new or unusual fields in each step’s prompt if you suspect it might spark additional creativity.
Conclusion:
This extended framework ensures that at each step, the LLM:

Breaks down the topic further,
Produces a set of actionable items or mini tasks (sub-step C in each phase),
Maintains a creative synergy that yields truly breakthrough-level solutions.
That’s how you can systematically push the LLM to produce both novel ideas and practical steps to realize them.
